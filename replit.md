# Pictallion Photo Management Application

## Overview

Pictallion is a comprehensive photo and video management application built with a modern full-stack architecture. The application implements a tiered processing system (Bronze → Silver → Gold) with AI-powered features for media analysis, face recognition, and automated tagging. It's designed to handle the complete lifecycle of media assets from ingestion through curation.

## User Preferences

### Project Structure
- `/client` - React frontend application
- `/server` - Express.js backend API
- `/shared` - Shared TypeScript schemas and types
- `/data/media` - Media storage directories (Bronze/Silver/Gold tiers)

## Key Components

### Database Schema
The application uses a relational database with four main tables:
- **users**: User authentication and management
- **mediaAssets**: Core media asset records with original filenames
- **fileVersions**: Different processing tiers of each asset (Bronze/Silver/Gold)
- **assetHistory**: Audit trail of all asset operations

### Tiered Processing System
1. **Bronze Tier**: Raw ingested media with basic metadata stored in batch folders
2. **Silver Tier**: AI-processed media with enriched metadata organized by date
3. **Gold Tier**: Curated, finalized media with embedded metadata

### AI Processing Pipeline
- **Image Analysis**: OpenAI Vision API for comprehensive image understanding
- **Metadata Extraction**: EXIF data parsing for technical details
- **Object Detection**: Confidence-scored object identification
- **Tagging**: Automated tag generation based on content analysis
- **Description Generation**: Short and long descriptions for searchability
- **Face Detection**: TensorFlow-based face recognition and cropping
- **Burst Photo Detection**: Intelligent grouping of similar photos taken within time windows

### File Management
- **Directory Structure**: Automated creation of required media directories
- **Batch Organization**: Bronze tier files organized in dated batches (max 500 files)
- **Duplicate Detection**: Perceptual hash-based duplicate identification (Gold tier only)
- **Burst Photo Grouping**: 95%+ similarity detection within ±1 minute time windows
- **File Validation**: MIME type checking and size limits (50MB)

### User Interface
- **Dashboard**: Overview with statistics and recent activity
- **Gallery**: Grid/list view with filtering by tier and search capabilities
- **Upload**: Drag-and-drop interface with progress tracking
- **Burst Photos**: Intelligent grouping and selection interface for burst sequences
- **People**: Face detection and person management
- **Duplicates**: Gold tier duplicate detection and resolution
- **Photo Detail Modal**: Comprehensive metadata display and editing

## Data Flow

1. **Media Ingestion**: Files uploaded via dropzone → temporary storage → Bronze tier
2. **Burst Analysis**: Bronze tier photos analyzed for burst sequences (95%+ similarity within ±1 minute)
3. **AI Processing**: Selected Bronze photos → Silver tier with AI analysis and metadata enrichment
4. **Human Review**: Silver tier metadata validation and editing
5. **Final Curation**: Silver → Gold tier for finalized media
6. **Duplicate Detection**: Gold tier photos scanned for duplicates using perceptual hashing

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Dev Server**: Vite development server with HMR
- **Backend**: tsx for TypeScript execution with file watching
- **Database**: Neon development database with automatic migrations

### Production Build
- **Frontend**: Vite production build with asset optimization
- **Backend**: esbuild for server bundling with external package handling
- **Static Assets**: Served via Express with proper caching headers

### Environment Configuration

- **AI Service**: Ollama running locally on `http://localhost:11434` (configurable via `OLLAMA_BASE_URL`)
- **AI Models**: `OLLAMA_MODEL` (default: llava:latest) and `OLLAMA_TEXT_MODEL` (default: llama3.2:latest)
- **Media Storage**: Local file storage at `/data/media` with organized directory structure

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Tiered Processing**: Separates raw uploads from processed content, enabling quality control and progressive enhancement
2. **Shared Schema**: TypeScript schemas shared between frontend and backend ensure type safety across the stack
3. **Serverless Database**: Neon PostgreSQL provides scalable, managed database infrastructure
4. **AI-First Metadata**: Local Ollama integration provides rich, searchable metadata automatically without external dependencies
5. **File System Organization**: Structured directory hierarchy supports scalability and maintenance
6. **Session-Based Auth**: Simple authentication model suitable for single-user or small team deployment

The application prioritizes reliability, scalability, and user experience while maintaining a clean separation of concerns between media processing, data management, and user interface layers.
