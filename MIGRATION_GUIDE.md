# Migration Guide: TypeScript to Python Backend

This guide documents the complete migration process from the legacy TypeScript/Node.js backend to the new Python/FastAPI backend.

## Overview

- All backend logic, services, and API routes have been converted to Python.
- Database schema migrated from Drizzle (TypeScript) to SQLModel (Python).
- Full API compatibility and feature parity maintained.

## Migration Steps

1. **Backup**: Create full backup of database and media files.
2. **Schema Conversion**: Translate Drizzle schemas to SQLModel.
3. **Data Migration**: Migrate all data, validate integrity.
4. **API Migration**: Convert all endpoints to FastAPI routers.
5. **Testing**: Run integration and compatibility tests.
6. **Performance Benchmarking**: Compare Python vs TypeScript backend.
7. **Deployment**: Switch production to Python backend.

## Lessons Learned

- Automated tests are critical for safe migration.
- SQLModel simplifies schema conversion and validation.
- FastAPI provides automatic OpenAPI docs and async support.

## Compatibility Matrix

| Feature                | TypeScript | Python |
|------------------------|:----------:|:------:|
| API Endpoints          | ✅         | ✅     |
| AI Processing          | ✅         | ✅     |
| Face Detection         | ✅         | ✅     |
| Tiered Processing      | ✅         | ✅     |
| Collections/Events     | ✅         | ✅     |
| Database Migrations    | Drizzle    | Alembic|
| Testing Framework      | Jest       | Pytest |

## Rollback Procedures

- Restore database and media files from backup.
- Revert API routing to legacy TypeScript backend.
- Validate system health and data integrity.

## Safety Measures

- Keep legacy backend available during migration.
- Use feature flags for gradual rollout.
- Monitor system performance and logs.
