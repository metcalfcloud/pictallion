echo ""

echo "5. üìÅ COLLECTION TESTING"
echo "   Goal: Test photo organization and collections"
echo "   Steps:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Create themed collections (e.g., 'Vacation', 'Family')"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Add photos to collections"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Test collection management features"
echo ""

echo "6. üîç SEARCH TESTING"
echo "   Goal: Test advanced search and filtering"
echo "   Steps:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Use search with AI tags (e.g., 'dog', 'mountain')"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Filter by date ranges"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Filter by camera/EXIF data"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Test tier-based filtering"
echo ""

echo "7. ‚ö° PERFORMANCE TESTING"
echo "   Goal: Test with larger datasets"
echo "   Steps:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Upload 20+ photos at once"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Test bulk processing (Bronze ‚Üí Silver)"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Test batch promotion (Silver ‚Üí Gold)"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Monitor processing speed and memory usage"
echo ""

echo "8. üñºÔ∏è FORMAT TESTING"
echo "   Goal: Test different file formats and sizes"
echo "   Upload photos with:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Different formats (JPG, PNG, TIFF)"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Various resolutions (phone photos, DSLR, etc.)"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Different aspect ratios (square, panoramic, portrait)"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Large file sizes (test 50MB limit)"
echo ""

echo "üì• QUICK TEST DATASET SUGGESTIONS:"
echo ""
echo "If you need test photos quickly:"
echo "‚Ä¢ Use your phone to take burst photos of any subject"
echo "‚Ä¢ Take selfies/portraits for face testing"
echo "‚Ä¢ Photo everyday objects for AI tagging (pets, food, etc.)"
echo "‚Ä¢ Take similar photos from slightly different angles"
echo ""

echo "üöÄ AUTOMATED TESTING WORKFLOW:"
echo ""
echo "1. Start with uploading 5-10 diverse photos"
echo "2. Go through Bronze ‚Üí Silver ‚Üí Gold for a few photos"
echo "3. Test each major page/feature:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Dashboard (overview stats)"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Gallery (photo browsing, filtering)"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Upload (drag-and-drop, progress)"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Burst Photos (grouping, selection)"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ People (face detection, assignment)"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Collections (creation, management)"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Duplicates (detection, resolution)"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Settings (configuration)"
echo ""

echo "‚úÖ VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:"
echo ""
echo "‚ñ° Photos upload successfully"
echo "‚ñ° AI processing generates tags and descriptions"
echo "‚ñ° Face detection works and crops faces"
echo "‚ñ° Burst detection groups similar photos"
echo "‚ñ° Duplicate detection finds similar photos in Gold tier"
